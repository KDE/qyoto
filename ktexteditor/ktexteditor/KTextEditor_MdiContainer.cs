    /// <remarks>
    ///  A container for MDI-capable kpart hosts.
    ///  The kpart container for the KTextEditor interface may have different
    ///  capabilities. For example, inside KDevelop or Kate, the container can
    ///  manage multiple views and multiple documents. However, if the kpart text
    ///  is used inside konqueror as a replacement of the text entry in html
    ///  forms, the container will only support one view with one document.
    ///  This class allows the kpart component to create and delete views, create
    ///  and delete documents, fetch and set the current view. Note that the
    ///  ktexteditor framework already supports multiple document and views and
    ///  that the kpart host can create them and delete them as it wishes. What
    ///  this class provides is the ability for the <i>kpart component</i> being
    ///  hosted to do the same.
    ///  An instance of this extension should be set with
    ///  ContainerInterface.SetContainerExtension().Check ContainerInterface() to
    ///  see how to obtain an instance of ContainerInterface. The instance should
    ///  inherit QObject, inherit MdiContainer, declare the Q_OBJECT macro and
    ///  declare a Q_INTERFACES(KTextEditor.MdiContainer) .
    ///  Code example to support MdiContainer (in the kpart host):
    ///  <pre>
    ///  class MyMdiContainer : public QObject,
    ///                         public MdiContainer
    ///  {
    ///       Q_INTERFACES( KTextEditor.MdiContainer )
    ///    public      // ...
    ///  }
    ///  </pre>
    ///  To check if the kpart hosts supports the MDI container:
    ///  <pre>
    ///  Editor  editor = KTextEditor.EditorChooser.Editor();
    ///  ContainerInterface  iface = qobject_cast<ContainerInterface >( editor );
    ///  if (iface) {
    ///    MdiContainer  mdiContainer = qobject_cast<MdiContainer >( iface.Container() );
    ///    if (MdiContainer != NULL ) {
    ///     // great, I can create additional views
    ///     // ...
    ///    }
    ///  }
