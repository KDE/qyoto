	///  Introduced in DOM Level 2
	///  The Event interface is used to provide contextual information about an event
	///  to the handler processing the event. An object which implements the Event
	///  interface is generally passed as the first parameter to an event handler.
	///  More specific context information is passed to event handlers by deriving
	///  additional interfaces from Event which contain information directly relating
	///  to the type of event they accompany. These derived interfaces are also
	///  implemented by the object passed to the event listener.
