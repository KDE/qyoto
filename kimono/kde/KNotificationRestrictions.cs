	/// <remarks>
	///  KNotificationRestrictions provides a simple mechanism to avoid disruptions
	///  during full screen presentations or other use cases where the screensaver or
	///  desktop notifcations are innapropriate.
	///  Using KNotificationRestrictions is quite straightforward: create an instance
	///  of KNotificationRestrictions, passing in the set of or'd flags representing
	///  the services that should be prevented from interupting the user. When done
	///  (for instance when the presentation is complete) simply delete the
	///  KNotificationRestrictions object.
	///  Example: to ensure the screensaver does not turn on during a presentation
	///  void MyApp.DoPresentation()
	///  {
	///    KNotificationRestrictions restrict(KNotificationRestrictions.ScreenSaver);
	///    // show presentation
	///  }
